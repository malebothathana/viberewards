### 🛠️ Supabase Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Account:**
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up or log in.

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Name your project (e.g., `loyalty-rewards`).
   - Set up a strong password and choose a region.
   - Click **Create new project**.

3. **Set Up Your Database Table:**

```sql
create table customers (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  phone text unique not null,
  visits int default 1,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

4. **Create a Function to Increment Visits:**

```sql
create or replace function increment_visits(user_phone text)
returns void as $$
begin
  update customers
  set visits = visits + 1
  where phone = user_phone;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
```

5. **Enable API Access:**
   - Go to **Project Settings > API**.
   - Copy your `anon` public API key and project URL.

### 🔑 Supabase Client Setup

In your HTML/JavaScript, import and initialize the Supabase client:

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project.supabase.co';
const supabaseKey = 'your-anon-public-api-key';
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
```

Replace `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseKey` with your actual values from the Supabase dashboard.

### ✅ App Logic

- When a phone number is entered and the "Check In" button is clicked:
  - If the number exists: it calls the `increment_visits` RPC function.
  - If the number doesn’t exist: a new customer record is created.

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Use **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to control access to tables.
- Never expose service_role keys in frontend code.
- Use Edge Functions or backend servers for sensitive operations if needed.
